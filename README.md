This is a small project I have been making in Godot when I have some spare time.

I've never touched Godot before or really any game development other than making a few maps for the Source engine back in High school.

I've only been using the odd tutorial and trying to focus on reading all documentation to understand how Godot projects are structured and what each node/part of the engine does.
This doesn't mean I haven't been researching. Of course, the best way of learning anything is by doing research. However, I feel that by reading the documentation, you will grasp a very broad understanding of the engine which you may not acquire from tutorials or research online.

The project at the moment, is a retro style first person horror game. I do have a full idea for the game and intend on continuing development and leading to an eventual release on Itch.io.
